# Employee Database System using Lombok in Java
This project demonstrates how to build an Employee Database System in Java using the Lombok library, which helps reduce boilerplate code and enhances productivity in Java development.

## Features
- Employee CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations: Add, retrieve, update, and delete employees from the database.
- Data validation: Input validation for employee data, such as checking for valid email addresses or phone numbers.
- Lombok annotations: Utilizes Lombok annotations to generate common Java code, such as getters, setters, constructors, and equals/hashCode methods, automatically, reducing the need for manual coding.
- Database integration: Connects to a relational database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve employee data.
- Exception handling: Properly handles exceptions and errors that may occur during the execution of the application.

## Technologies Used
- Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the Employee Database System.
- Lombok: A Java library that provides annotations to generate common boilerplate code automatically, improving code readability and reducing development time.
- JDBC: The Java Database Connectivity API for connecting to relational databases and performing CRUD operations.
- SQL: The Structured Query Language for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in the database.
- Maven: A popular build automation tool for managing project dependencies and building Java applications.
- IDE: An Integrated Development Environment such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing, building, and running the Java code.

## Getting Started
To use this Employee Database System, follow the steps below:

- Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

- Import the project into your preferred IDE.

- Configure your database connection properties, such as database URL, username, password, and driver class, in the `application.properties` file.

- Build the project using Maven or your IDE's build tools.

- Run the application, which will start the Employee Database System.

- Use the provided API or user interface to perform CRUD operations on the employees in the database.

## Usage
The Employee Database System provides APIs or user interface to perform CRUD operations on employees. You can use the available endpoints or UI to:

- Add a new employee to the database
- Retrieve employee details by ID, name, or other criteria
- Update employee information
- Delete an employee from the database
- The Lombok annotations used in the project, such as `@Data`, `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, etc., automatically generate the corresponding code for these operations, making the code concise and readable.
